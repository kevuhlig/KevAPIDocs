Kevin Uhlig's API Documentation with Sphinx
===========================================

This is my sandbox site on how I authored RESTful API non-reference and reference content in Sphinx. Utilize the ``Edit on GitHub`` link in top right corner of a page to see its Sphinx code. 

**Note:** For the API reference section, I utilized `Shippo API <https://goshippo.com/docs/reference#addresses>`_ content. 

.. toctree::

   usage/Addresses
