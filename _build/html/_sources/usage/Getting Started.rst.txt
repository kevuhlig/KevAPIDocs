================

Explains the first steps users must take to start using the API. 

* Signing up for an account
* Getting API keys
* Making a request
* Reviewing the endpoints available
* Calling a specific endpoint
* Show the general pattern for requests â€“ List out the full resource URL that user can refer to when needed. The Full URL is not listed in each endpoint section because redundant.
