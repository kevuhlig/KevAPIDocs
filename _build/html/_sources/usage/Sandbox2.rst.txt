Locking an object
-----------------

To lock an object send a POST request to the ``/@lock`` endpoint that is available on any content object in Plone:

..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: lock.txt

If the lock operation succeeds, the server will respond with status term ``200 OK`` and return various information
about the lock including the lock token. The token is needed in later requests to update the locked object.
